### How to Use

1. **Install the Tools:**
   - Save the `install.sh` script as `install.sh`.

   - Save the `bugrecon.sh` script as `bugrecon.sh`.
   - Make the script executable with `chmod +x bugrecon.sh`.
   - Run `./bugrecon.sh` to start the BugRecon interface.

### Key Features

- **Ease of Use:** The `install.sh` script automates the installation of all necessary tools, while the `bugrecon.sh` script provides an intuitive interface for running tasks.
